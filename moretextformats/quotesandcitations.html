        There's much written on www about history of the <br>
         Internet.For example, about the first graphical Internet <br>
         browser on the web - Mosaic. <br><br>
        <blockquote> is the first widely-used graphical<br>
         World Wide Web browser, released on April 22,<br>
          1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.<br>
           A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.</blockquote><br><br>
            Today's Internet browsers we use today<br>
             (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),<br>
              got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.<br>
